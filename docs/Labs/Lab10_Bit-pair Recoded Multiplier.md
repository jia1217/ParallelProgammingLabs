# Lab10_Bit-pair Recoded Multiplie

## Lab Overview

In this lab you will implement a Bit-pair Recoded fixed point multiplier in Verilog. The top-level entity should be a structural design, and all lower-level components should be kept completely modular and use Verilog parameters. The processor should be tested in Vivado Simulator with appropriate testbench(es) that that test for all cases (+/-
and varying ranges) in an 8-bit multiplier. You will map your top-level entity to the board which will use a shortened
4-bit version of the multiplier.

## Multiplier Design

You are to design an N-bit shift-add multiplier using bit-pair recoding. Each
component in the design should be a separate module that you will connect in your top-level structural entity. You will be required to set the design to 4-bits to program it to the board and 8-bits when performing test bench
simulations.

Model your design based on the figure below. Multiplication will begin when the start signal is high and the busy signal is low (note, busy and done are set by the state machine, **Ctrl**). The system will multiply through the following steps:

* 1) Load the *multiplicand* and *multiplier* into their corresponding registers and activate the *busy* signal. 

* 2) Iteratively perform N/2 add/shift cycles. (N is the number of bits in the multiplicand and multiplier)

* 3) Activate the *done* signal in the last clock cycle when the product is on the output.

* 4) Deactivate the *busy* and *done* signals while the machine waits for the next multiplication.

## Understanding Multiplication

This multiplier utilizes a very similar algorithm to the one we typically learn in grade school but for binary numbers. This algorithm works by partitioning the multiplier into its distinct digits and then
iteratively performing (multiply => add => shifts) until all the digits of the multiplier have been used. Compare the following decimal and binary multiplication algorithms.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/19.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Moving to binary multiplication there are a few things we need to consider.

* 1) Recoding – Rather than directly multiplying by the binary digit we use booth encoding to determine the
digit (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) to multiply by.

* 2) Shift – Shift by two binary digits rather than one, this implies N/2 iterations of the algorithm rather than N.

* 3) Signs – The sign of a binary number is indicated by the leading digit, rather than a `-` sign. Be careful to
ensure the sign of your values are preserved while performing shifts and additions. For example, in the 2nd
add, the addition of 2 negative number should never be positive; however, if we do not sign extend
properly our leading bit will be 0. This is a common issue.


## Implementation Details

Most of the components in this design should be fairly familiar to you by now. However, this design is fairly optimized, so here are a few clarifications to help you implement it.

### Multiplication

This design decomposes the multiplier into a
series of {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} that represents it. The reason we do this
is that multiplying any binary number by these values is super
easy to implement. All these implementation requires are shift
(<<), NOT, sign extends, and +1 operations. Of these, the most
difficult to perform is the +1. Luckily, since we already have an
adder in our design, we can absorb this +1 operation into it. We
do this by passing that +1 in as the carry in bit of the adder when
the partial product is added. Se the figure for more details.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/20.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/></div>

### ProductReg

The product register is optimized to store the product, partial
product, and multiplier at different times during the multiplication operation.
The accompanying figure attempts to depict how each flip-flop in the register
is mapped to the other components. Upon starting a new multiplication the
system will initialize the most significant N+2 bits and the least significant
bits of this register with 0’s and bits 1 to N with the multiplier. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/21.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/></div>

Then, the 3 least significant bits will be used to determine the first partial
product. This will be added to the running partial product contained in bits N+1 to 2N+1 and stored in bits N+1 to 2N+2. Then, each of the will be shifted rightward in the register copying the sign bit for the top two bits. This will occuer N/2 times until the multiplication is complete. The product will be contained in bits 1 to 2N after completion.
In the figure below is an example of how data would move through the Product Register as the product -6 x -5 is computed.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/22.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

### Ctrl and TimerReg

 Similar to the previous lab the control unit drive the control signals of the other components to
orchestrate the multiplication. However, this time it also comes with a TimerReg. This is because we know exactly how many add/shift cycles week need to complete to compute and fixed width multiplication (N/2). This TimerReg, works as an alarm that signals to the control unit that it is finished and needs to stop the add shift cycle. There are many ways to implement this alarm. But, one of the easiest is to utilize another shift register. When the multiplier starts an operation, this register is initialized to a specific N-bit value such as “100…00” then after each cycle is completed you shift the bits by 1, “010…00”. After N cycles the 1 will have shifted all the way to the right, “000…01”, which can be easily used to send a signal to the controller to tell it to conclude the operation.



## Demoing on the board

You are to map a 4-bit instance of your top-level entity to the board. You should test 4 different multiplications: (-2 x 7), (6 x 5), (5 x 6), and (4 x -7).

We will map ```clk``` port to button, so we also need the debouncing module like below:

**btn_lab4.v**
```verilog

// Module definition for lab 4 button interface with parameterizable data width N.
module btn_lab4 #(
    parameter N = 4  // Define the data width for the system.

    input rst,               // Global reset signal.
    input key,               // Input signal from a physical button.

    input [N-1:0] multiplicand,    // Data input port for the multiplicand.

    reg [7:0] key_buffer;    // Buffer to store states of the key for debouncing.
    reg key_reg;             // Register to hold the debounced key value.
    
    // Debounce logic for the key input, triggered on clock edge or reset.
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
        if (!rst)
            key_reg <= 1'b0;  // Clear the key register on reset.
        else if (key == 1'b1)
            key_reg <= 1'b1;  // Set the key register if key input is high.
        else 
            key_reg <= 1'b0;  // Clear the key register if key input is low.
    end

integer i; 
    // Update key buffer on each clock cycle, used for edge detection.
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
        if (!rst)
            key_buffer <= 8'b0;  // Reset the key buffer on reset.
        else begin
            // Sequentially fill the buffer based on the debounced key value.
            for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin

        .done(Done)                // Connect to the done signal output.
    );
    
endmodule


```

Now we can see the ```Schematic``` under the RTL ANALYSIS part like below:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/23.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/></div>

For the system module, we can see:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/24.png" alt="drawing" width="1200"/></div>

### Creating a testbench

Then we can run Simulation to check the code of the ```Bitpair_Mult``` module.

**tb.v**
```verilog
// Define a testbench module for the Bitpair_Mult
module BitPairMult_tst();

    // Define variables for loop iterations and their maximum values
    integer i;
    integer j;
    integer max_i = 4; // Maximum value for i loop
    integer max_j = 4; // Maximum value for j loop
    
    parameter N = 4; // Bit width for multiplicand and multiplier

    // Testbench control signals
    reg clk;        // Clock signal for synchronization
    reg rst;        // Reset signal to initialize the module
    reg start;      // Start signal to trigger multiplication

    // Input values for the multiplier
    reg [N-1:0] multiplican; // Input multiplicand
    reg [N-1:0] multiplier;  // Input multiplier
    
    // Outputs from the multiplier module
    wire busy;               // Indicates if the module is currently processing
    wire done;               // Indicates if the multiplication is complete
    wire [2*N-1:0] product;  // The result of the multiplication

    // Instantiate the Bitpair_Mult module with parameter N
    Bitpair_Mult #(
        .N(N)
    ) dut (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .start(start),
        .multiplican(multiplican),
        .multiplier(multiplier),
        .product(product),
        .busy(busy),
        .done(done)
    );
    
    // Clock generation block
    initial begin
        clk <= 1'b0; // Initialize the clock to 0
        // Toggle clock every 5 time units to create a clock signal
        repeat (2*(2 + max_i * max_j * 3 + 3)) begin
            #5 clk <= ~clk;
        end
    end
    
    // Test sequence block
    initial begin
        $display("Running testbench"); // Display message on simulation start
        
        // Initialize inputs
        rst <= 1'b0;         // Assert reset initially
        start <= 1'b0;       // Ensure start is low
        multiplican <= 0;    // Initialize multiplicand
        multiplier <= 0;     // Initialize multiplier
        #10;                 // Wait for two clock cycles
        rst <= 1'b1;         // De-assert reset to start module operation
        #10;                 // Wait for two more clock cycles before starting test

        // Set test values for multiplicand and multiplier
        multiplican <= 4'b0100; // Set multiplicand to 4
        multiplier <=  4'b1001;  // Set multiplier to -7
    //  multiplican	<= 4'b1110;//-2
    //  multiplier	<= 4'b0111;//7
    //  multiplican	<= 4'b0110; //6
    //  multiplier	<= 4'b0101;//5
    //  multiplican	<= 4'b1010; //-6
    //  multiplier	<= 4'b1011;//-5
        #2;                      // Wait a short time
        start <= 1'b1;           // Assert start to begin multiplication
        #4;                      // Wait two clock cycles
        start <= 1'b0;           // Deassert start to simulate single pulse
        #4;                      // Wait two more clock cycles for results



    end

    
endmodule


```



And we can run Simulation to check the code by clicking the ```Run Simulation``` under the ```SIMULATION``` and choose the first ```Run Behavioral Simulation```. Here, the function of the ```clk``` is the same as the ```submit``` of the lab8.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/25.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/></div>

The multipican is 4 and the multipier is -7, then the result is -28.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/26.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/></div>

The multipican is -2 and the multipier is 7, then the result is -14.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/27.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/></div>

The multipican is 6 and the multipier is 5, then the result is 00111110, which is equal to the 30.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/28.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/></div>

The multipican is -6 and the multipier is -5, then the result is 30.


### Implementation

The part can reference the [Generate Bitstream](https://uri-nextlab.github.io/ParallelProgammingLabs/Labs/Lab1_led.html#generate-the-bitstream) in lab1.

The block design is shown below:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/29.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></div>


For the value of ```start``` ```multiplican``` ```multiplier``` ports can be read from the ```AXI_GPIO``` IP, and we need to write data to the ```product``` input ports by ```AXI_GPIO``` and the ```key``` port will map to the button(L19) and the ```Done``` port will map to the LED(M14)  and the ```Busy``` will map to the LED(R14) of the board.

### Download the bitstream file to PYNQ

We need to download the design_1_wrapper.bit to the local machine. Go to Lab9/project_1/project_1.runs/impl_1, download design_1_wrapper.bit, and upload the file to the PYNQ. And we also need to upload the design_1.hwh  file which is in the Lab9/project_1/project_1.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/hw_handoff.

```python
from pynq import Overlay
from pynq import Bitstream
bit = Bitstream("design_1.bit")
bit.download()
bit.bitfile_name

```

```python
from pynq import MMIO 
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS = 0X41200000
GPIO_RANGE = 0x1000
start_write = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS, GPIO_RANGE)
```

```python
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS = 0X41210000
GPIO_RANGE = 0x1000
multiplican = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS, GPIO_RANGE)
```

```python
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS = 0X41220000
GPIO_RANGE = 0x1000
multiplier = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS, GPIO_RANGE)
```

```python
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r = 0X41230000
GPIO_RANGE = 0x1000
product = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r, GPIO_RANGE)
```


```python
representations = {
    '0': ('###', '# #', '# #', '# #', '###'),
    '1': ('  #', '  #', '  #', '  #', '  #'),
    '2': ('###', '  #', '###', '#  ', '###'),

    '4': ('# #', '# #', '###', '  #', '  #'),
    '5': ('###', '#  ', '###', '  #', '###'),
    '6': ('###', '#  ', '###', '# #', '###'),
    '7': ('###', '  #', '  #', '  #', '  #'),
    '8': ('###', '# #', '###', '# #', '###'),
    '9': ('###', '# #', '###', '  #', '###'),
    '-': ('   ', '   ', '###', '   ', '   '),
    '.': ('   ', '   ', '   ', '   ', '  #'),
}

def seven_segment(number):
    # treat the number as a string, since that makes it easier to deal with
    # on a digit-by-digit basis
    digits = [representations[digit] for digit in str(number)]
    # now digits is a list of 5-tuples, each representing a digit in the given number
    # We'll print the first lines of each digit, the second lines of each digit, etc.
    for i in range(5):
        print("  ".join(segment[i] for segment in digits))
```

```python
DATA_OFFSET = 0X0
DATA_0 = 0x06
DATA_1 = 0X05
multiplican.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA_0)
multiplier.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA_1)
```

```python
start_write.write(0x0,1)
```

Then we need to press the button(L19) until you can see the LED(M14) is on which means the process is done. And we need to press the button again and you can see the LED is off and we can see the result below:

```python

    # Convert to decimal and subtract 1 to get the magnitude
    signed_decimal = -1 * (int(inverted_str, 2) + 1)

```
<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/35.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

```python

    signed_decimal = -1 * (int(inverted_str, 2) + 1)
else:
    # If the number is positive, just convert directly
    signed_decimal = int(binary_str, 2)

seven_segment(signed_decimal)

```python
DATA_OFFSET = 0X0
DATA_0 = 0x0a #-6*-5
DATA_1 = 0X0b
multiplican.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA_0)
multiplier.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA_1)
```

```python
start_write.write(0x0,1)
```

Then we need to press the button(L19) until you can see the LED(M14) is on which means the process is done. And we need to press the button again and you can see the LED is off and we can see the result below:

```python
seven_segment(product.read(0x0))# Decimal value
decimal_value = product.read(0x0)

# Convert the decimal value to an 8-bit binary string
binary_str = format(decimal_value, '08b')

# Convert to signed decimal
if binary_str[0] == '1':  # Check if the number is negative in two's complement
    # Invert the digits
    inverted_str = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_str)
    # Convert to decimal and subtract 1 to get the magnitude
    signed_decimal = -1 * (int(inverted_str, 2) + 1)
else:
    # If the number is positive, just convert directly
    signed_decimal = int(binary_str, 2)

seven_segment(signed_decimal)```
```
