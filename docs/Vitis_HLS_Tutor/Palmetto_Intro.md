# Clemson Palmetto Server Introduction

## Create an account

Step 1: Apply for a palmetto account on CCIT using the following link;

- [Create palmetto account](http://clemson.cherwellondemand.com/CherwellPortal/IT/One-Step/CITIAccount)

Step 2: Once you get the account, contact CCIT again via email to let the administrator give you permission for accessing `/project/twei2` folder.

Step 3: The `/project/twei2` is a folder shared by Nextlab. Hence, do not touch anything else inside the `project/twei2` folder. You can create your projects in your own home folder `/home/<user_name>`. Everybody should have 100GB storage space, which is more than enough for this course. 


Take myself as an example, 

```bash
    mkdir -p /project/twei2/home/michelle
```
